# VNDB Autofill for AB Editors

This userscript autofills VNDB information into visual novel torrent group pages to save time for AnimeBytes Editors. That's about it. It's really only useful for AnimeBytes Editors, not many others. This is only on GitHub so I have someplace to store the update script.

## Installation

This userscript supports the majority of the major browsers and userscript extensions. To install it, just open [the user script](https://github.com/winneon/ab-vndb-autofill/raw/master/vndb.user.js) in a new tab; the extension should detect it and bring up an installation menu. See below for a complete list of supported software.

### Firefox 57+, Google Chrome, Vivaldi

* Violentmonkey (recommended)
* Greasemonkey (Firefox only, version 4.0+ required)
* Tampermonkey

### Firefox 56 and prior, Firefox forks (Pale Moon, etc.)

All of these are untested. If you use this userscript with one of the above browsers and it works with any of the below extensions, please let me know and I'll update this README.

* Greasemonkey (Firefox only) (recommended)
* Violentmonkey
* Tampermonkey
